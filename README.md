# TicTacToe in Python

------



### Objectives

------

* Implement a TicTacToe game in Python 3

* Apply python unittest library

### How to play

------

* The game allows two players, *X* and *O*, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

### Status & future development

------

The engine is near-complete, and my personal goals have been met.

Future work is likely to involve an alternative test framework or language, somewhat similar to the same-task different-implementation approach of GDCR.
